        <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of
            flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two
            cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the
            sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil
            leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into
            it.</li>
