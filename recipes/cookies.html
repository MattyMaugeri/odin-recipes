    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Making bakery-worthy chocolate chip cookies is much easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list
        and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>

    <p>
        These are the kitchen staples you'll need to make the best chocolate chip cookies of your life:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong>This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed
            with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough
            together.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong>A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff
            the cookies up.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the
            cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate chip:</strong>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk
            chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make chocolate chip cookies from-scratch:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
